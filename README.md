# â˜• coffee.mykal.codes

A simple microblog for my coffees and thoughts on coffee.

## Functional goals 

- A webapp that shows some of my recent coffees and notes on them.
- A simple interface for uploading new photos and notes on my coffees. 
- A simple way for people to like / react to my posts.
- A log of my coffees over time, maybe some fun graphs. 

## Technical goals

- Astro-based frontend (`/services/app`)
  - Should have a performant, accessible, and homepage.
  - Should provide an admin interface for writing and editing posts.
  - Should have animations using framer motion (want to learn).
- Go-based api (`/services/api`) 
  - Should use the standard go 1.22 `net/http` package.
  - Should provide cookie-based/bearer authentication for me to login with.
  - Should use `gorm` and postgresql for the database.
  - Should allow users to upload photos through to cloudflare images.
- Web server reverse proxy to stitch things together (`/services/server`)
  - Should act as a reverse proxy for both the frontend and api 
  - Should provide a simple way to manage scaling up services if needed.  

### Note: on splitting the app and api apart

I realize that astro is more than capable to handle the API portion. I want to learn go so I'm taking the chance to split the frontend and the API out.
